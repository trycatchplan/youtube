# Welcome to TryCatchPlan
Simple app to browse the *.wav and *.jpg file(s) in the ./media/ folder. Requires two (2) buttons - one for "Up" and one for "OK" - though U/D/L/R, Start, Select, A (Back), and B (OK) have stub functions.
```
python3 -m venv .
source bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
And normally it's just...
```
source bin/activate
python app.py
```
Have a glorious day!
